# CORE - Centralized Operational Reporting Engine

## Overview
CORE (Centralized Operational Reporting Engine) is a data processing and querying tool that interacts with Elasticsearch, Postgres, and SQLite, featuring a React-based UI. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the application. *This code is protected intellectual property*; for details, please see the license file or refer to the license section at the end.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python (version >= 3.8)
- pip (for Python package management)
- Node.js and npm (for the frontend interface)
- Elasticsearch (version 8.x or above)
- PostgreSQL (version >= 12.x)

## Project Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
```
### 2. Python Dependencies
First, make sure your Python environment is properly set up. Install all Python dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: The requirements.txt file is still in development. It may not include all requirements at present.*

### 3. Configuration Setup
You need to adjust two configuration files to match your local environment.

#### config/sys_config.json
This file sets some global configurations for logging, NLP models, and paths. With the testing flag set to ```False``` it will only run through the Elasticsearch logic flow, unless data was stored to the fallback CSV during processing.

Example:

```json
{
    "logging": {
        "log_directory": "./logs"
    },
    "nlp": {
        "model": "en_core_web_sm"
    },
    "keywords": {
        "default_path": "./utilities/default_keywords"
    },
    "output": {
        "fallback_csv": "~/Downloads/CORE_fallback_test.csv"
    },
    "testing_mode": {
        "_comment": "Change testing_flag to true to test all storage options.",
        "testing_flag": false
    }
}
```
Adjust the paths as necessary based on where you want log files or CSV outputs stored.

#### config/settings.json
This file sets up connections to the databases and other services. You'll need to change the following fields based on your local setup (example for Windows):

```json
{
    "directory": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\data",
    "user_config": {
        "postgres": {
            "minconn": 1,
            "maxconn": 10,
            "user": "your_postgres_user",
            "password": "your_postgres_password",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": "5432",
            "database": "your_database_name"
        },
        "elasticsearch": {
            "hosts": ["https://localhost:9200"],
            "basic_auth": {
                "user": "elastic",
                "password": "your_elastic_password"
            },
            "verify_certs": true,
            "ca_certs": "path/to/your/ca.crt",
            "index": "your_index_name"
        },
        "sqlite": {
            "sqlite_directory": "path/to/your/sqlite/directory"
        },
        "keywords": {
            "keyword_dir": "path/to/your/keywords"
        },
        "logging": {
            "log_directory": "../logs"
        }
    }
}
```
Update this file to reflect your Postgres, Elasticsearch, and SQLite paths, credentials, and other configurations.

### 4. Setting Up the Frontend (React App)
Navigate to the UI folder:

```bash
cd CORE/user_interface/ui
```
Run the following command to install all the required npm packages listed in package-lock.json:

```bash
npm install
```
To start the React frontend:

```bash
npm start
```
This will start the React application, which can be accessed in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000). It will also initialize all three backend APIs, sequentially. Check the terminal output or log file for status.

##  Running the Application
- Start your backend services (Elasticsearch, Postgres, etc.).
- Open the React frontend in your browser and begin interacting with the application.

## Directory Structure
- **config/:** Contains ```sys_config.json``` and ```settings.json``` to be customized for your environment.
- **core/:** Contains core logic for initializing and testing the central backend functionality. Primary entry point for backend services.
- **data_extraction/:** Contains the logic for extracting data from files.
- **data_processing/:** Contains the logic for processing the files and the extracted data.
- **database_operations/:** Contains logic for managing and structuring database classes and interactions.
- **file_handling/:** Contains logic for I/O operations.
- **initialization/:** Contains logic for initialization of the backend, including configurations and logging.
- **logs/:** Stores logs generated by the application.
- **search_functionality/:** Contains the logic for querying Elasticsearch. Primary entry point for search interface.
- **tests/:** Contains unit tests, subset of synthetic data for testing, and development logging script for tracing logic flow.
- **update_functionality/:** Contains logic for initiating the processing logic and checking for new data. Primary entry point for update interface.
- **user_interface/ui/:** Contains the React frontend.
- **utilities/:** Includes helper modules for logging, configurations, and data management.

## Future Changes / Future Developments
- **API Expansion:** Expanding API functionality for advanced querying and data manipulation.
- **API Reformatting:** Reformatting APIs to match RESTful standards.
- **User Roles and Permissions:** Introducing user roles for different access levels within the frontend.
- **Loading Splashpage:** Adding a "Loading" splashpage prior to the homepage, only moving on once the entire backend has initialized.
- **Updating Search Results:** Updating mapping logic, refining results list, and adding individual result-specific viewing pages.
- **Expanding Map Results:** Expanding map results to show images extracted from files at specific locations.
- **Building out Settings Page:** Allowing user-defined settings within the user interface.
- **Building out Update History Page:** Tracking all prior updates within the user interface.
- **Codebase Cleanup:** There are legacy components and outdated code from past versions of the application that will be gradually removed as development progresses.
